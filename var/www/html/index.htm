The tokenserver API is located at api/v1/<br />
<br />
There will only be  one endpoint to retreive tokens.<br />
You _must_ put a trailing slash at the end. I am trying to fix this but it is not a big deal.<br />

<ul>
    <li>api/v1/get_tokens/ - get tokens from database</li>
</ul>

You can get to it <a href='api/v1/gettokens/'>here</a><br />
<br />
