# tokengenerator-debian

Dockerized token generator for catspeed fork, based on Debian

#### Due to technical reasons, this will only work for catspeed fork, found at https://github.com/catspeed-cc/invidious

The project was basically finished in ~12 hours. Will make documentation, images and upload to dockerhub or other later.

**Why Debian?** Well the alpine image is so stripped down, I had issues with installing node and getting it to work. So I chose my next favorite, Debian. From what I understand the size difference is probably ~200MB.

#### Project is in development. No release dates set. Please wait patiently :3c
